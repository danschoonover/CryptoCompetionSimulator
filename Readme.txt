This python notebook simulates a prize distribution (ie payout scheme) for a fitness challenge. Each competitor who participate would pay a fixed fee, and the requirements for the prize distribution was as follows:
1) Competitors who rank highest should receive the largest payouts and
2) lower-ranking competitors should still received some real/positive payout and
3) all competitors should be incentivized to participate and to re-enroll in future competitions via these winnings.

The harmonic series was found to be a good fit for this criteria, and so was used in this script.
