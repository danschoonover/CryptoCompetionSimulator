This python notebook simulates a prize distribution (ie payout scheme) for a fitness challenge. To participate, each competitor pays a fixed fee, and all participants will receive some payment regardless of rank in the competition.
The requirements for the prize distribution was: competitors who rank higher should receive the highest payouts, while lower ranking competitors should still received some real/positive payout. 
The harmonic series was found to be a good fit for this criteria, and so was used in this script.
